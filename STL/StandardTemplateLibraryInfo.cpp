/**
 * Standard Template Library
 * 
 * HISTORY:
 *  - developed at HP 
 *  - fast reusable containers and algorithms
 *  - rely heavily on templates
 * 
 * CORE:COMPONENTS:
 * container classes, algorithms and iterators form the core components
 * container classes represent data
 * algorithms represents operations on data
 * iterators serve as the connection between the above
 * STL also includes classes on concurrency, random numbers, regular expressions, utilities, etc
